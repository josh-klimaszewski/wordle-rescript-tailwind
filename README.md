This will replace the development artifacts, compile the ReScript code as well as copy `public/index.html` into `dist/`. You can then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory (`index.html` and `Index.js`).

If you make use of routing (via `ReasonReact.Router` or similar logic) ensure
that server-side routing handles your routes or that 404's are directed back to
`index.html` (which is how the dev server is set up).
